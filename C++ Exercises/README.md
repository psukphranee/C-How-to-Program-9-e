# About 

This directory contains worked out excercises, scratchwork, and reproduced examples from C++: How to Program 9e.
The approach to self-guided teaching is Disect -> Study -> Recreate. The Disect and Study process builds a big
picture from the technical details. The Recreate takes us in the opposite direction, writing code from the big
picture previously drawn.
