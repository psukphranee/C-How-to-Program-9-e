initialize array to 11 elements
loop through each elements
  print the grade interval
    print the number of counts
===
initialize gradeDist to an array of 11 integers

set the counter to zero
while the counter is less than the size of the array
  if the counter is zero then display "  0-9:"
  otherwise if the counter is 10, then display "  100:"
  otherwise display 10 times the counter, a hyphen, and 10 times the counter plus 9

  set a different counter to zero
  while the counter is less than or equal to the array at the counters' element value
    display *
    increment this counter
  make a new line

  increment outter counter
  display a newline
===
set the arraySize variable to 11 (type size_t)
initialize gradeDist to an array of arraySize, integers

display heading

set i to zero
while the i is less than gradeDist's size
  if i is zero then display "  0-9:"
  otherwise if i is 10, then display "  100:"
  otherwise display 10i, a hyphen, and 10i+9

  set a j to zero
  while the j is less than or equal to the array at the gradeDist[i]
    display *
    increment j
  make a new line

  increment i
  display a newline
