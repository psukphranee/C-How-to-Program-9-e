Set game status to CONTINUE

Roll Dice
Determine the next game status based on curernt status and roll sum
display the outcome
==
RF3:
Init point to zero
Init sum of faces to zero
seed the random number generator with time
Set game status to CONTINUE of WIN, LOSE, CONTINUE

Call the dice rolling function
    Rolls each dice
    displays die faces
    return the sum of faces

Determine the next game status based on curernt status and roll sum

        if its 7 or 11 then status is WIN
        if 2,3,13 then LOSE
        otherwise CONTINUE and set the point to the sum of faces

While the status is CONTINUE
    Call the dice rolling function
    Determine the game status

If the game is won, display won, otherwise display loss
==
Init point to zero
Init sum of faces to zero
seed the random number generator with time
Set game status to CONTINUE of WIN, LOSE, CONTINUE

Call the dice rolling function and assigns to sumOfFaces
    Rolls each dice
    displays die faces
    return the sum of faces

Determine the next game status based on curernt status and roll sum
