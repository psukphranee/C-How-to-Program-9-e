while the possible movemnets isn't 0
  find index of the first smallest accessibility number
  move to that number
  increment the move counter
  mark that coordinate on the gameboard with the move counter number
  determine possible movements
=======================================================================
while the possible movemnets isn't 0
  -call a function to return the smallest index of the coordPossibleMovements array
  -update current row and current column to the corresponding coordinates
  -increment the move counter
  -let gameBoard @ update coordinates equal the move counter
  determine possible movements
