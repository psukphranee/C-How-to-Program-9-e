getMinimumScore()
initialize minimum to 100
loop through scores and replace minimum with any lower score
return minimum

initialize minimum to 100
loop through rows
  loop through columns
    if the current element is less than minimum then set it otherwise nothing
return minimum
=============================================
getAverage(row)
initialize an integer sum to zero
loop through the elements and update the sum
return a double of the sum divided by the exam number
=============================================
outputGrades
display grades in tabular format
-------------------------
display "The grades are:\n\n"
display headers: blank, test_i, average
display "Student 1" << setw(8) << score1 << setw(8) << score2 << ... << average with width 9
-------------------------
display "The grades are:\n\n"
display 10 spaces, test1 to test 3, and average
loop through grades array, couter i starting at 0
  display "Student" i+1
  loop through row i of the grades array, using counter j
  display each grade

  display the average of the row
  display a newline
--------------------------
display "The grades are:\n\n"
display 10 spaces, test1 to test 3, and average
loop through grades array, counter i starting at 0
  display "Student ", with padding 2 then i+1
  loop through row i of the grades array, using counter j
  display each grade[i][j] with width 8

  display the value of function average with the argument, row i
  display a newline
=============================================
outputBarChart
Display "Overall grade distribution:\n"
count the frequency of each score
display a bar chart of the frequency
---------------------------
Display "Overall grade distribution:\n"
initialize an 11 element frequency array, 11 to account for the edges of inner of each gradeIntervals
loop through all items
  increment the frequency element at score divded by 10

loop through frequency array starting at 0
  explicitly display 0-9 and 100 because of offset
  use an algorithm for the rest;
  loop from 0 to the frequency at i
    output an asterisk
