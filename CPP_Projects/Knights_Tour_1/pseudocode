Moving functions
  There are 8 possible L-shaped moves. Each move is a linear combination of (1,2) horizontal steps and (2,1) vertical steps.
  We'll put the moves into a 2D array.

  The 8 possible moves will correspond to indices 0-7. Refer to page 330.

Heuristic Grid
  Loop through the 8x8 grid.
    For each element, find the 8 coordinates corresponding to the 8 possible knight moves.
      Loop through each of the 8 pairs of possible coordinates and count the ones that are within the chess board boundaries.
      i.e. both the horizontal and vertical indices are between 0 and 7 inclusive.
      sum up the count and set this value to the hueristic grid.

===================================================
Starting at some position,
  list out the possible moves
  sort them in order of accessibility, in ascending order. we want to move towards lower numbered grids
  move to the lowest valued grid thats possible
    label the grid moved to with the move count
  keep going until we reach a grid where there are no more possible movements

  =================================================
  Need to spearate the heuristic labeling part out of the possibleMoves function.
  heuristicLabel() should call possible moves.

  heuristicLabel assigns a number to each coordinate
  loop through all of the coordinates in the 8x8 grid
    find the coordinates of the resulting 8 moves
    filter out ones that are in the grid boundary
    count them
    label the coordinate with this count

  possibleMoves function takes an array and fills it with coordinates
  resulting from the 8 types of moves.
