Knights Tour

One of the more interesting puzzles for chess buffs is the Knights Tour problem. The question is this: Can the chess piece called the knight move around an empty chessboard and touch each of the 64 squares once and only once?

An intuition of a solution is developed by running this puzzle by hand. Spaces towards the edge of the board are harder to access, meaning there are fewer spots to jump to and from to get to it. For example, the corner spaces can be accessed by only two spaces. So we have to be careful not to traversed those two spaces without hitting the corner space.

Each spot on the board can be labeled with an accessibility value, given by how many surrounding spaces can be accessed from that spot. In the case of the corner space, we'll give it an accessibility value of 2.

We use this labeling scheme to develop a heuristic for the game board. Using such information, we'll traverse the least accessible spots first. In the event where more the surrounding spots are tied for least accessibility value, we'll randomly select a spot to traverse.
