4 Parameters:
-Number of disks to be moved
-Initial peg
-Destination peg
-Buffer peg

For recursion, test for the base case. Otherwise, do a recursive call.

If the number of disks is 1, then move the disk from the initial peg to the destination peg
Otherwise call the move function to move k-1 pegs to the buffer peg, then move the k-th peg to
the destination peg.

=====
If the number of disks to move is one, then display an arrow from the initial_peg to the destination_peg
Otherwise, move k-1 disks from the initial_peg to the buffer_peg. Then move disk k from the initial_peg to the destination_peg.
