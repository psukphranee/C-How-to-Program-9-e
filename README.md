# C++11 Projects and Exercises

The **CPP_Projects** folder contains projects from the chapters exercises, which incorporate topics from everything covered up to that chapter of the C++ How To Program 9e book.

The **CPP_Exercise** folder isn't important. It contains reproduced examples and single-concept based projects.
